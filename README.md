# Versitron Airport Surveillance Fiber Converter

The **Versitron Airport Surveillance Fiber Converter** is designed to deliver secure, high-speed fiber optic connectivity for airport security camera systems. By converting copper Ethernet to fiber, it enables the transmission of high-resolution video across long distances with zero signal loss—crucial for maintaining safety and operational efficiency in large, complex airport facilities.

## Product Overview

Airports are high-security environments that require constant, reliable surveillance coverage across terminals, runways, parking areas, baggage handling zones, and restricted access points. The Versitron fiber converter ensures that IP cameras remain connected to control rooms without interference, even over extended distances.

With support for gigabit Ethernet speeds, robust EMI/RFI immunity, and industrial-grade durability, this converter is built to handle the demands of continuous operation in mission-critical airport environments.

## Key Features

- **Gigabit Ethernet Performance**: Handles HD and 4K video streams from multiple surveillance cameras.
- **Long-Distance Transmission**: Extend IP camera connectivity up to 80 km over singlemode fiber.
- **Industrial-Grade Design**: Rugged housing for reliable operation in busy airport conditions.
- **Electromagnetic Immunity**: Fiber eliminates interference from heavy equipment and radio systems.
- **Connector Options**: Available with LC or SC fiber interfaces.
- **Plug-and-Play Installation**: Fast deployment with minimal setup time.
- **Diagnostic Indicators**: LED status lights for power, link, and data activity.
- **Flexible Mounting**: Suitable for rack or DIN rail installation in control rooms.

## Applications

- **Terminal Security**: Monitor passenger areas, boarding gates, and check-in counters.
- **Baggage Handling**: Oversee luggage conveyor systems and restricted loading zones.
- **Runway & Apron Surveillance**: Maintain high-clarity monitoring over wide outdoor areas.
- **Parking Lot Security**: Extend coverage to remote vehicle storage and access points.
- **Customs & Immigration Areas**: Ensure security in sensitive inspection zones.
- **Operations Centers**: Centralize video feeds from multiple airport sectors.
